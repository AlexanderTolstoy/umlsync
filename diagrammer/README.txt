UML Sync
============

UML Sync is a web-based tool designed to help projects and companies keep
track of pending source code structure changes and make code documentation much less painful and
time-consuming. 

It is being developed for use with GitHub, but it is designed to be
generic enough to use in any project. 

It currently has support for SVN and Git repositories.

Server side is written using Django and Python.
